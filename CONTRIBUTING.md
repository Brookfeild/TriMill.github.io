### Contribution Guidelines

When making contributions to this repository please follow these guidelines.

1) trimill.github.com is a family-friendly and work- and school-appropriate place. Strong language and adult topics will not be tolerated.
2) Test any code thoroughly before committing it.
3) When creating projects, duplicate the "default" project directory and begin from there.
4) Comment code when appropriate. Optimal code should be so self-explanatory that comments are not needed, but in practice this is impossible. Too many comments can actually make code harder to read.

Thank you for assisting squashing bugs or whatever you're trying to do.
